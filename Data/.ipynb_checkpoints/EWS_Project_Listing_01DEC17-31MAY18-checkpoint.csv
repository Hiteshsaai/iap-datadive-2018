The cost has arisen as a result of three-fold increase in the number of project affected households to be resettled in Kibera and Mukuru in Kenya, whose number has risen from 3,500 in 2005 when the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was first prepared to 10,006 in 2010. The delay in RAP implementation was mainly due to post-election violence and conflicts, and the need to include a wider 'protection' or safety zone in light of high density occupation along the railway tracks. The updated RAP was disclosed in January 2011. In addition, the restructured activities and the projected higher cost of civil works and installations contracts apply to all four participating countries.The affected contracts involve the implementation of:resettlement and safety infrastructure covered in the RAP in Kenya;One Stop Border Posts (OSBP), in three countries;port Integrated Security Systems (ISSs), Kenya and Tanzania;weighbridges, Kenya and Tanzania;Electronic Cargo Tracking (ECT), Uganda and Rwanda; andrailway Internal Container Depot (ICD), Uganda.This project is part of the Programme for Infrastructure Development In Africa (PIDA)","Contact: Jean-Francois MarteauTitle: Transport.

In September 2016, mere days before its board would consider the project, the newly formed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank announced that it was considering co-financing the Myingyan project. This alert has been updated accordingly. The following Early Warning System Alert has been prepared in partnership with the NGO Forum on ADB, an Asian-led network of civil society organizations, based in Asia and the Pacific region who monitor the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Asian Development Bank.***Risk Assessment: Category A. This project is co-financed by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). As this is co-financed, the AIIB will apply IFC's environmental and social standards and policies. The IFC classifies the Project as a Category A project because it is a large, complex project with correspondingly significant risks and impacts on the environment. According to the IFC's environmental and social review procedure, this project has been classified as Category A ""due to concerns about expansion of industrial activities in this rural area including cumulative impacts to air quality' influx of migrant construction labor, and the related community health and safety risks; and potential relocation of approximately 5 to 10 families of settlers without land titles or legal claims along the river water pipeline right of way.""The Myingyan project is an investment to ""build, own and operate a greenfield 225 MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power plant in the Mandalay region of Myanmar."" In addition to IFC, ADB, and potentially AIIB funding, A consortium of Sembcorp Utilities Pte. Ltd and MMID Utilities Pte. Ltd will develop and operate the project. The Project includes the construction and operation of the following facilities:- 225MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine Power Plant;- Gas Supply Pipeline;- 230kV Overhead Transmission Line; and- Water Supply Pipeline, Wastewater Discharge Pipeline and Water Intake Pumping Station.Project documents state that construction will begin in the first quarter of 2016, with an aim to open the project facilities for operation by the first quarter of 2018.Location: The project is located in Taungtha, a township of the Myingyan District in the Mandalay Divison of central Myanmar. The power plant will occupy about 11.6 hectares, which will be situated within a 280 hectare government-owned and operated steel mill site (Myingyan Steel Mill No.4).Resources needed: 8 hectares of land acquired for a 12 kilometer cooling water supply line and 3 kilometer overhead power transmission line, affecting 8 to 10 families without legal claims whose homes and small businesses may be physically displaced.","AIIB Officer:Chuanzhi Su (csu@aiib.org)CONSULTATIONSWith respect to AIIB funding, civil society groups, such as NGO Forum on ADB, have raised concerns over the fact that this project was publicly disclosed for AIIB funding several days before board consideration. The disclosure practices for this project also circumvent other disclosure requirements of co-financiers, such as the ADB requirement for 120 days notice before board approval for high risk Category A projects. NGO Forum on ADB has also raised issues with this project going forward where the AIIB has yet to approve an energy policy.The available IFC documents provide information about existing and planned consultations. IFC documents state that, as part of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment process, three rounds of local stakeholder consultations were conducted from June to September 2015. The purpose of the first round was to ""disclose project information"" and ""gather stakeholder feedback,"" while the purpose of the next two rounds were to provide updates on issues raised previously, to ""present the outcomes of the impact assessment process, including management measures,"" and to ""gather stakeholder feedback.""According to IFC - Villages and Consultation Dates (2015) were:Sa Khar - July 18, 2015; August 19; September 4Hnan Ywa - July 16, 2015; August 19; September 4Hpet Taw - July 17, 2015; August 19; September 3Nyaung Kan - July 17, 2015; August 19; September 5Gyoke Pin - July 19, 2015; August 18; September 5Thien Ywa - July 18, 2015; August 18; September 5Tha Pyay Thar - July 19, 2015; August 18; September 2IFC documents note that the main concerns brought up during these consultations were: employment, availability and quality of surface and ground water, access to electricity, air emissions and health implications, and noise. Villagers in Sa Khar were particularly concerned because heat generated from the adjacent steel mill killed their crops and made their land inviable. According to project documents, ""[t]his concern has been fed into the design of the Project - due to the height of the stacks on site it is not anticipated that there will be any significant heat discharged and noise management measures will be put in place.""The following three villages will also be engaged moving forward: Ayea, Hla Nuang Tang, and Kaing Taung.

The proposed Orinoquia Sustainable Integrated Landscape (OSIL) project is part of a broader program for the region, funded by the BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes (ISFL). The 'ISFL program' will be implemented in two phases: a Technical Assistance (TA) phase and an emission reduction (ER) phase via the establishment of a performance-based payments mechanism to achieve AFOLU GHG emission reductions at a regional level. The Theory of Change for the project follows an analysis of direct and indirect causes of emissions in Orinoquia, considering the critical factors that need to be addressed to reverse the situation. These factors are then clustered into components of the project. The logic is the following: AFOLU emissions in the Orinoquia27 should be divided into two groups: historic emissions and projected emissions. Both, historic and future emissions are due to land use change and land management practices. The main direct causes of historic emission include deforestation, forest degradation, unsustainable livestock practices, fertilizers, and fires; while projected emissions are due to future deforestation, conversion of natural habitat, transformation of agriculture cropping systems and agricultural management practices such as fertilizer use, enteric fermentation, rice cultivation, etc.","For more info, contact:Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) Claudia Ximena Cuervo Director Innovation& Technological Developmentclaudia.cuervo@minagricultura.gov.coMinistry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MADS) Angelica Maria Mayolo Obregon Director, Office of International AffairsAMayolo@minambiente.gov.coNational Planning Department (DNP) Javier Ignacio Perez Burgos Director Sustainable Territorial Developmentjaperez@dnp.gov.coInstituto de Hidrologia, Meteorologia y Estudios Ambientales (IDEAM) Maria Teresa Becerra Subdirector in Ecosystemsmtbecerra@ideam.gov.coThe World Bank 1818 H Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20433 Telephone: (202) 473-1000ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM OF WORLD BANKThe World Bank Inspection Panel is the independent complaint mechanism and fact-finding body for people who believe they are likely to be, or have been, adversely affected by a World Bank-financed project.

Per IPCC climatic scenarios and the baseline information on the impacts of CC on people's livelihoods and ecosystems (see Section C.2), it is estimated that climatic variations would have significant and differentiated effects and intensities in various sectors. In particular, family farming would experience significant reductions in productivity in crops such as cotton, bean, cassava, sesame and sugarcane. Reduced productivity leads to a change of production type and can have important livelihoods impacts as well as social, environmental, economic and cultural effects in the rural sector that can ultimately impact resilience to CC.","For more information about this project, contact:Daniel Gustafson, Deputy Director-General (Programmes) And Officer-in-Charge, TC (FAO):Daniel.Gustafson@fao.org;DDG-P@fao.org;(+39) 06 570 56320; Viale delle Terme di Caracalla 00153 Roma, Italia"

This inadequate financing access, coupled with the limited transmission network to access sources of affordable and readily available hydroelectricity, has restricted SMEs in key energy consuming sectors to develop energy efficiency investments projects, including: (i) the exchange of old equipment with new efficient equipment that reduces use of firewood, biomass and other fossil fuels ; (ii) the exchange of old equipment with new efficient equipment that replaces use of firewood, biomass and other fossil fuels by electricity from hydropower; and (iii) the retrofit of equipment with new efficient equipment that that reduces use of firewood, biomass and other fossil fuels. 2. Access to these investments1 could reduce energy consumption from non-renewable energy source, mainly biomass, and reduce greenhouse emissions by about 4 million tCO2eq over the project's lifetime, in addition to promoting increased SME productivity gains. GCF reimbursable funding will help increase medium and long-term financing for energy efficiency (EE) projects in SMEs by supporting the structuring of financing mechanisms and instruments and improve local financial institutions (LFIs) and SMEs' local technical capacity and knowledge on EE investments. Thus, GCF funding will increase energy efficiency in the SMEs industrial sector, with reduced GHG emissions through diminished demand of non-sustainable biomass and other fossil fuel energy sources. 3. GCF funding will be channeled through a sovereign-guaranteed loan from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), according to its own policies and procedures, to the Agencia Financiera de Desarrollo (AFD), a second-tier national development bank (NDB). The GCF reimbursable resources, which will be maintained in a dedicated account, will be blended with AFD's own resources in order to provide a concessional line of financing available to first-tier local financial institutions (LFIs) so that they can, in turn, offer financing at adequate terms and conditions to SME firms interested in adopting eligible EE measures.

When exercising the right to lodge a complaint against the EIB, any member of the public has access to a two-tier procedure, one internal - the Complaints Mechanism Office - and one external - the European Ombudsman. A complaint can be lodged via a written communication addressed to the Secretary General of the EIB, via email to the dedicated email address complaints@eib.org, by completing the online complaint form available at the following address: http://www.eib.org/complaints/form, via fax or delivered directly to the EIB Complaints Mechanism Division, any EIB local representation office or any EIB staff. For further details, check: http://www.eib.org/attachments/strategies/complaints_mechanism_policy_en.pdfWhen dissatisfied with a complaint to the EIB Complaints Mechanism, citizens can then turn towards the European Ombudsman. A memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the EIB and the European Ombudsman establishes that citizens (even outside of the EU if the Ombudsman finds their complaint justified) can turn towards the Ombudsman on issues related to 'maladministration' by the EIB. Note that before going to the Ombudsman, an attempt must be made to resolve the case by contacting the EIB. In addition, the complaint must be made within two years of the date when the facts on which your complaint is based became known to you.

The implementation of these projects will first enable a better carbon sequestration. The improving of water resource mobilization, through the building of boreholes, haffirs and other water infrastructures, and the introduction of new climate resilient practices, such as drought resilient seeds, will benefit communities in having better crop productivity, and thus, boost their economic growth. This process will enable a reduction of conflicts, especially about resources availability. Moreover, the introduction of sustainable land management with activities of reseeding and re-plantation will also have an important impact to reduce natural resources scarcity and poverty, but also on reducing soil erosion and increasing soil fertility. Providing veterinary services and training for communities about new climate resilient practices will improve food security and benefit for the whole regions in reducing conflicts and migrations.The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project is calculated at 21%, the net present value (VPV) is estimated at USD 1.71 millions. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) to the project is estimated at 25% and the net present value (NPV) at 12% opportunity cost of capital is estimated at USD 2.19 millions.The project will have both direct and indirect benefits. Improved livelihoods for the agro-pastoral communities will be the main direct benefit. The emphasis on a multi-level, integrated approach to pastoral development through support and funding for a range of initiatives will help pastoralist communities and households undertake livestock and no-livestock income generating activities, accompanied by awareness raising, information and capacity building.A parallel dynamic of social inclusion and economic growth will help reintegrate the most vulnerable and marginalized population categories into the local economy and combat the social and economic marginalization in which many pastoral groups are trapped. For instance, the creation of new boreholes and water supply networks in villages will reduce periods of unemployment/inactivity due to lack of irrigation boosting economic growth at the village level and improving villagers' livelihoods. Farmers' income is expected to increase from better crop productivity as a result of sustainable irrigation schemes and the introduction of new adaptive practices and appropriate technological package into crop production.Additional programme benefits include an increased value of livestock through the setting up of veterinarian services, thus further improving food security, and reducing vulnerability to external shocks such as animal disease outbreak. The efforts of the project to provide micro financing will benefit to pastoralists and agro-pastoralists to diversify their sources of livelihoods.National economies and regional integration will also benefit from the program. Effective cooperation in the management of water resources and improved rangeland management would reduce conflicts and promote social stability and strengthen regional integration. The development of market infrastructures and the improvement of the delivery of animal health related services, mainly the prevention and control of TADs will contribute to an increase of intra- and extra-regional safe trade in livestock products.The methodology used to estimate these project benefits is based on a costs benefits analysis. Indeed, assessing the costs and benefits of a program is of essential importance to meaningfully quantify its impacts. Following the GEF approach, a baseline model is required, in this case the DRSLP II and III project. The global environmental benefits and the incremental costs, and besides, the project impacts, are compared to the baseline project without the support of the GEF. This comes down to analysing the situation with and without the additional GEF funded project.For each country, Somalia and Sudan, this comparison has been made, to assess the economic and financial performances of the country projects.","BOULANOUAR Bouchaib - RDGE2ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM OF AfDBThe Independent Review Mechanism (IRM), which is administered by the Compliance Review and Mediation Unit (CRMU), is the independent complaint mechanism and fact-finding body for people who have been or are likely to be adversely affected by an African Development Bank (AfDB)-financed project.

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM OF EIB

The EIB Complaints Mechanism is designed to facilitate and handle complaints against the EIB by individuals, organizations or corporations affected by EIB activities. When exercising the right to lodge a complaint against the EIB, any member of the public has access to a two-tier procedure, one internal - the Complaints Mechanism Office - and one external - the European Ombudsman. A complaint can be lodged via a written communication addressed to the Secretary General of the EIB, via email to the dedicated email address complaints@eib.org, by completing the online complaint form available at the following address: http://www.eib.org/complaints/form, via fax or delivered directly to the EIB Complaints Mechanism Division, any EIB local representation office or any EIB staff. For further details, check: http://www.eib.org/attachments/strategies/complaints_mechanism_policy_en.pdf 

When dissatisfied with a complaint to the EIB Complaints Mechanism, citizens can then turn towards the European Ombudsman. A memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the EIB and the European Ombudsman establishes that citizens (even outside of the EU if the Ombudsman finds their complaint justified) can turn towards the Ombudsman on issues related to 'maladministration' by the EIB. Note that before going to the Ombudsman, an attempt must be made to resolve the case by contacting the EIB. In addition, the complaint must be made within two years of the date when the facts on which your complaint is based became known to you. You can write to the Ombudsman in any of the languages of the European Union. Additional details, including filing requirements and complaint forms, are available at: http://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/atyourservice/interactiveguide.faces"

The solar park is being developed by Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Limited (RUMSL), via a transaction advised on by IFC's Public Private Partnership team. RUMSL is a joint venture company promoted by Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (MPUVNL) - a Madhya Pradesh State Government agency and the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) - a Government of India controlled parastatal.MRPL is 100% subsidiary of Mahindra Susten Private Limited (""MSPL"" / Sponsor""). Mahindra Susten is a Cleantech arm of the Mahindra group and leading solar EPC services company/contractor in India which offers solar power, renewable energy solutions and utility scale solar plants. The Mahindra group is US $19 billion global federation of companies, headquartered in Mumbai, India, with operations in over 100 countries around the globe.The letter of award (LOA) was issued to MRPL by RUMSL on 21st February, 2017 appointing MRPL as the project developer to implement the Unit I of the solar park and subsequently, Power Purchase Agreement (PPAs) were executed on 17th April, 2017 between MRPL, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC / Procurer), RUMSL and M.P. Power Management Company Limited (MPPMCL/ Procurer).The solar park is being developed by Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Limited (RUMSL), via a transaction advised on by IFC's Public Private Partnership team. RUMSL is a joint venture company promoted by Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (MPUVNL) - a Madhya Pradesh State Government agency and the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) - a Government of India controlled parastatal.The solar park is proposed on 1500 hectares (ha) of land acquired by RUMSL across five villages, namely, Badwar, Barsaita Desh, Barsaita Pahad, Etar Pahad and Ramnagar Pahad under Gurh Tehsil in Rewa District. The entire solar park site lies on plateau lands which form part of the larger Vindhyan Plateau. The entire solar park site is devoid of vegetation cover and covered with rocky sandstone and minimal topsoil. The solar park is drained by two natural drainage channels that traverse the site diagonally from north east to south west. Though the solar park land is spread across five villages, no residential settlements or hamlets of these villages are located close to the solar park boundary. The nearest residential settlement is few kilometers away from the park boundary. The entire perimeter of the project site will be fenced to a height of around 8 feet and entry to the project site will be regulated.The solar park is equally divided into 3 units, each of which will have a 250 MWac solar power plant. MRPL has won project development rights for Unit I (1235 acres) of the park which is located near villages Badwar and Barsaita. The company proposes to use combination of polycrystalline / monocrystalline / thin film modules and fixed tilt / seasonal tilt / tracker technology.The Company will enter into turnkey EPC contract with one of its group company - M/s Mahindra Susten Private Limited - to execute the construction of the project and operation & maintenance of the project. The project will be completed and commissioned in stages starting from February 2018 and the final handover date is December 2018. Around 500 - 550 workers are expected to be employed during peak construction, and around 65 employees will be required to operate the plan during operations, excluding another 100 or so part-time unskilled workers who will be involved in panel cleaning. A worker accommodation camp housing about 200 persons will be established within the site boundary during the construction phase.The proposed IFC investment involves a straight senior loan up to INR 3200 million (equivalent of US$50 million) and may assist in mobilization of the syndicated parallel loan of up to another INR 64000 million (equivalent of US$100 million) (together ""the Investment""). Proceeds from the IFC investment will used by the company for the development, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of a solar photovoltaic plant of 250 MWac (Unit I in the solar park). IFC Board has approved to finance two more projects in the same solar park (both the projects have been disclosed at (https://disclosures.ifc.org/#/projectDetail/ESRS/39866 and https://disclosures.ifc.org/#/projectDetail/ESRS/39711).The company has a land use permission agreement with RUMSL for the 482.594 ha of land allocated for Unit I. RUMSL is responsible for providing encumbrance free land, evacuation infrastructure and other common facilities consisting of the following:* A 33/220 kV Unit substation inside the allocated premises; and* A 220 kV transmission line for evacuation of power from this substation to a new grid sub-station.The operation and maintenance (O&M) of these evacuation assets will be undertaken by the respective project developers, such as MRPL. Power from individual units will be evacuated to a new 220/400 kV solar park grid sub-station being constructed by M/s Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) - a Government of India owned power transmission utility company - on 18 ha of land within the solar park premises. The solar park will be connected to the national grid via a 32km long 400kV transmission line being constructed by PGCIL between the grid sub-station and Vindhyachal-Jabalpur 400 kV DC Line and is expected to be commissioned by in 2-3 months' time.

With a market capitalization of approximately US$200 million and 2016 sales of approximately US$141.5 million, the Company is the second largest upholstered sofa manufacturer in China in terms of export value to the U.S. Morris integrates the functions of design, research and development, manufacturing, online and off line sales, and after sales services. The proposed IFC investment will support Morris' capacity expansion program for i) additional production facilities and working capital in both Cambodia and China in order to address production bottlenecks and growing demand and ii) refinancing of short term debt (together, the ""Project"").

South-South Investment and Higher Operational Efficiencies: 
Cambodia: The Project entails the transfer of knowledge and technical expertise as well as foreign direct investment from China to Cambodia, developing a stronger South-South value chain in the forestry and wood products sector. As a supplier to demanding U.S. and Canadian markets with stringent industry standards, Morris is well-placed to disseminate these practices to less developed countries. The adoption of best industry practices is expected to strengthen technological capacity and bring process improvements to the furniture industry in Cambodia, improving competitiveness at a larger scale than what is currently prevalent in the country. 

China: In addition, the China component of the Project will help the Company achieve even greater economies of scale in China, leading to more competitive products for domestic consumption as well as export markets. The planned expansion in China is expected to increase the Company's production by 30%.  

The proposed Project would build a new production facility in Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) in line with IDP's vision. By undertaking a phased approach that starts with textile-based production (sofa covers) the Company is utilizing Cambodia's existing comparative advantages but is planning to invest in training and skill-building necessary to transition to furniture manufacturing and assembly. A successful outcome of the project is expected to demonstrate to international investors that Cambodia is a viable place of origin for high quality furniture and potentially attract new players. Furthermore, the Project is expected to have a positive impact on the local economy by upgrading the domestic manufacturing industry, diversifying exports, and integrating the country into new global value chains, thus strengthening its resilience to economic shocks.","Morris Holdings Limited

In addition, Stage 2 will support domestic foam system houses to ensure adequate supply of substitutes, provide technical assistance (TA)to the foam sector, and support the government's regulatory agenda.The project will provide investment support to 12 companies. Four companies with HCFC consumption of at least 20 MT each will introduce cyclopentane (CP) as foam blowing agent and eight companies (7-20 MT) will convert to pre-blended CP polyols. The technology deployed, safeguard requirements and the replacement process will be the same as for Stage 1. About 200 companies with HCFC-141b consumption below 7 MT will switch to pre-blended hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) -- a new and currently more expensive technology with low upfront investment cost. They will receive vouchers as financial incentive, which they can use to buy pre-blended polyol at a discount.

The investor has applied for a MIGA guarantee for a period of up to 20 years against the risk of breach of contract.The project involves operation of a 255 megawatt, run-of-the-river hydropower plant on the Victoria Nile by Bujagali Energy Ltd. (BEL). The project was developed on a build-own-operate-transfer basis and reuses water flowing from two existing upstream facilities to generate electricity. The first generating unit was commissioned in February 2012, and the project reached full capacity in June 2012. The proposed investment is not expected to result in any change to the project's physical or operational footprint or to its current power transmission arrangements.The Agency first supported this project in June 2007, when MIGA issued a guarantee totaling $115 million to World Power Holdings Luxembourg S.a.r.l. (WPH), an affiliate of Sithe Global (USA), to cover its investment in the construction of Bujagali hydropower project. The coverage was issued for a period of up to 20 years against the risk of breach of contract. MIGA subsequently increased its cover to $120.3 million in July 2012, following WPH's increase of its equity investment in the project.On August 27, 2014, MIGA also issued guarantees totaling $9.5 million to Absa Bank Limited of South Africa and Standard Chartered Bank of the United Kingdom, two of the existing senior lenders for the Bujagali Hydropower project. The two lenders entered into a swap arrangement with Bujagali Energy Limited to hedge against long-term interest rate risk. MIGA's coverage on the lenders' swap was issued against the risk of breach of contract for a period of 11 years.On June 10, 2016, MIGA also disclosed a Summary of Proposed Guarantee for SN Power's potential investment in the project.The newly proposed guarantee would cover BHPCL's existing and new investments in the project.Environmental CategorizationThe project is a Category A under MIGA's Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability. Click here to view the Environmental and Social Review Summary prepared by the IFC for their investment in the project.Development ImpactReliable and accessible electricity is critical for Uganda's social and economic development. Daily power shortages have stunted economic growth by an estimated one percent of the country's gross domestic product. The Bujagali project increased supply to the national power grid at the lowest cost compared to other power generation expansion options under Uganda's energy strategy, thereby reducing outages and costs.In addition to MIGA's guarantee, the World Bank Group has been supporting the project with $130 million in loans from the IFC and a partial risk guarantee of up to $115 million from the International Development Association. The loan for IFC's own account will change to $100 million, following the refinancing, which is currently under way.","No project contacts available at the time of disclosureACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM OF MIGAThe Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) is the independent complaint mechanism and fact-finding body for people who believe they are likely to be, or have been, adversely affected by an IFC or MIGA- financed project.

The project will increase China's installed wind capacity by 200MW and will displace GHG emission equivalent to 390,000 metric tons of CO2 each year, supporting the country's plans to significantly increase the contribution of renewable energy to its energy mix in line with its Intendeda Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) commitment. China's INDC outlines a vision of reduction of 60-65% in emission intensity of China's GDP by 2030 from 2005 levels and achieving 20% of generation based on non-fossil fuels versus 12% in 2016. The majority of installed generation capacity in China is in traditional coal-fired plants and using cleaner generation will help alleviate the severe air pollution problem in China.","Concord New Energy Group Ltd

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM OF EIB
The EIB Complaints Mechanism is designed to facilitate and handle complaints against the EIB by individuals, organizations or corporations affected by EIB activities. When exercising the right to lodge a complaint against the EIB, any member of the public has access to a two-tier procedure, one internal - the Complaints Mechanism Office - and one external - the European Ombudsman. A complaint can be lodged via a written communication addressed to the Secretary General of the EIB, via email to the dedicated email address complaints@eib.org, by completing the online complaint form available at the following address: http://www.eib.org/complaints/form, via fax or delivered directly to the EIB Complaints Mechanism Division, any EIB local representation office or any EIB staff. For further details, check: http://www.eib.org/attachments/strategies/complaints_mechanism_policy_en.pdf 

When dissatisfied with a complaint to the EIB Complaints Mechanism, citizens can then turn towards the European Ombudsman. A memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the EIB and the European Ombudsman establishes that citizens (even outside of the EU if the Ombudsman finds their complaint justified) can turn towards the Ombudsman on issues related to 'maladministration' by the EIB. Note that before going to the Ombudsman, an attempt must be made to resolve the case by contacting the EIB. In addition, the complaint must be made within two years of the date when the facts on which your complaint is based became known to you. You can write to the Ombudsman in any of the languages of the European Union.

When exercising the right to lodge a complaint against the EIB, any member of the public has access to a two-tier procedure, one internal - the Complaints Mechanism Office - and one external - the European Ombudsman. A complaint can be lodged via a written communication addressed to the Secretary General of the EIB, via email to the dedicated email address complaints@eib.org, by completing the online complaint form available at the following address: http://www.eib.org/complaints/form, via fax or delivered directly to the EIB Complaints Mechanism Division, any EIB local representation office or any EIB staff. For further details, check: http://www.eib.org/attachments/strategies/complaints_mechanism_policy_en.pdf 

When dissatisfied with a complaint to the EIB Complaints Mechanism, citizens can then turn towards the European Ombudsman. A memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the EIB and the European Ombudsman establishes that citizens (even outside of the EU if the Ombudsman finds their complaint justified) can turn towards the Ombudsman on issues related to 'maladministration' by the EIB. Note that before going to the Ombudsman, an attempt must be made to resolve the case by contacting the EIB. In addition, the complaint must be made within two years of the date when the facts on which your complaint is based became known to you. You can write to the Ombudsman in any of the languages of the European Union. Additional details, including filing requirements and complaint forms, are available at: http://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/atyourservice/interactiveguide.faces"

A memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the EIB and the European Ombudsman establishes that citizens (even outside of the EU if the Ombudsman finds their complaint justified) can turn towards the Ombudsman on issues related to 'maladministration' by the EIB. Note that before going to the Ombudsman, an attempt must be made to resolve the case by contacting the EIB. In addition, the complaint must be made within two years of the date when the facts on which your complaint is based became known to you. You can write to the Ombudsman in any of the languages of the European Union. Additional details, including filing requirements and complaint forms, are available at: http://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/atyourservice/interactiveguide.faces"

The EIB Complaints Mechanism is designed to facilitate and handle complaints against the EIB by individuals, organizations or corporations affected by EIB activities. When exercising the right to lodge a complaint against the EIB, any member of the public has access to a two-tier procedure, one internal - the Complaints Mechanism Office - and one external - the European Ombudsman. A complaint can be lodged via a written communication addressed to the Secretary General of the EIB, via email to the dedicated email address complaints@eib.org, by completing the online complaint form available at the following address: http://www.eib.org/complaints/form, via fax or delivered directly to the EIB Complaints Mechanism Division, any EIB local representation office or any EIB staff. For further details, check: http://www.eib.org/attachments/strategies/complaints_mechanism_policy_en.pdf 

When dissatisfied with a complaint to the EIB Complaints Mechanism, citizens can then turn towards the European Ombudsman. A memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the EIB and the European Ombudsman establishes that citizens (even outside of the EU if the Ombudsman finds their complaint justified) can turn towards the Ombudsman on issues related to 'maladministration' by the EIB. Note that before going to the Ombudsman, an attempt must be made to resolve the case by contacting the EIB. In addition, the complaint must be made within two years of the date when the facts on which your complaint is based became known to you. You can write to the Ombudsman in any of the languages of the European Union. Additional details, including filing requirements and complaint forms, are available at: http://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/atyourservice/interactiveguide.faces"

The project will contribute to the increase in railway share as a core transportation mode of the country and to the modal shift from roads to rail. The modal shift and the efficient rolling stock will reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emission.

Bangladeshi transport system consists of roads, railways, inland waterways, seaports for maritime shipping and civil aviation facilities. Historically, the railway enjoyed a monopoly as a carrier and transported most principal commodities, but the railway began losing market share declining from 30% in 1975 to mere 4% in 2015 for both passenger and freight transports. The drop in the market share of the railway as a carrier is the result of the long-term underinvestment in railway infrastructure and operational improvement of Bangladesh Railway. Recognizing the virtues of the railway as a cheaper, safer and fuel-efficient transportation mode, the government places special emphasis on railway development and set targets to increase railway market share through prioritized investment in railway infrastructure, focusing on network capacity improvement, operational capacity improvement and railway reform implementation. The project aims at improving the operational capacity and efficiency of Bangladesh Railway. The project is aligned with ADB's country partnership strategy for Bangladesh 2016-2020 which emphasizes the importance of easing infrastructure constraints by undertaking transformational investments and promoting policy reform in key sectors such as energy, transport and urban development as a priority investment area.","PROJECT CONTACTS

Through the two earlier interventions, ADB has provided long-term debt financing and catalyzing private sector participation through the implementing agency, i.e. Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) which substantially contributed to economic growth in the country. The design of the project serves to catalyze commercial financing for public-private partnership (PPP) projects, thereby reducing the pressure of direct financing on the public budget. An additional objective of the facility is to help provide the rural population and small to medium enterprises with clean and affordable electricity either through grid-connected or off-grid energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions. Solar home systems (SHSs) will not be financed under PPIDF 3 given the market saturation and availability of funding from partner donors.

A key design element of the proposed Third Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF 3) is the introduction of the multitranche financing facility (MFF) financial intermediary (FI) lending modality. The MFF-FI modality is particularly well suited for FI interventions which provide long-term funding to public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects. These PPP interventions are typically developed in a phased manner based on project implementation requirements. The MFF modality allows the borrower, IDCOL, to onlend financing for subprojects based on readiness criteria including finalization of risk-sharing arrangements, readiness of engineering procurement and construction, and phased release of equity. The disbursement to a subproject can take place through multiple tranches with time-slicing given the typical characteristic of staggering of payments, and thereby providing IDCOL the flexibility to plan cost-effective disbursements of subprojects.","PROJECT CONTACTS

The value chain will link farmers to a handling and intermediary network, which in turn will link to end users that include food processors, retailers and exporters. There is a critical role for the private sector to invest in, manage and operate the value chain infrastructure and services. Private sector participation, including through public-private partnership, is key to future program sustainability. The rationale for public sector intervention is to address failure in the market to provide appropriate price premiums for safe food which thus deters private sector investment in the value chain.

Although Bangladesh has achieved food self-sufficiency there remain problems with food security and access to safe, diverse and nutritious diets. Bangladesh is also experiencing rapid urbanization and a growing middle class that demands a more diversified diet and safer and more nutritious foods. However, food safety is constrained by poor on-farm and post-harvest management practices, lack of food safety standards and testing procedures, and quality assurance along the value chain. Additional problems with the prevalent traditional marketing system include physical and quality losses from farm to consumer often exceeding 30%, and high price volatility from inability to store perishable products. To address these problems will require (i) investment in value chain infrastructure including collection and distribution centers, cold storages, refrigerated transport, and testing facilities; (ii) improve the capacity of actors in the value chain to produce, process, distribute and market safe food; and (iii) provide credit to facilitate adoption of new technologies and private infrastructure.","PROJECT CONTACTS

Bridges and culverts will be widened, strengthened road safety features will be included, and the improved road assets will be maintained for five years after construction.

The vision of the Highways Department, Government of Tamil Nadu, as stated in its Policy Note (2016-2017), is to _increase the capacity, connectivity, efficiency and safety of the highways system._ Per the state''s policy, all state highways will be widened to double-lane and all major district roads will be widened to intermediate lane. Into the future, as traffic continues to increase, there will be need to infuse greater funding into the transport sector, including the road sector. Along with industrial connectivity, higher population and vehicular densities need road capacity improvement, which is primarily sought to be addressed in this project.

The project is consistent with the strategic objective set out in the Country Partnership Strategy on expansion of infrastructure networks for transport along economic corridors, and focus on improved road connectivity at the state, district, and rural levels to improve access to services and enhance productivity and incomes.

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM OF EIB

The EIB Complaints Mechanism is designed to facilitate and handle complaints against the EIB by individuals, organizations or corporations affected by EIB activities. When exercising the right to lodge a complaint against the EIB, any member of the public has access to a two-tier procedure, one internal - the Complaints Mechanism Office - and one external - the European Ombudsman. A complaint can be lodged via a written communication addressed to the Secretary General of the EIB, via email to the dedicated email address complaints@eib.org, by completing the online complaint form available at the following address: http://www.eib.org/complaints/form, via fax or delivered directly to the EIB Complaints Mechanism Division, any EIB local representation office or any EIB staff. For further details, check: http://www.eib.org/attachments/strategies/complaints_mechanism_policy_en.pdf 

When dissatisfied with a complaint to the EIB Complaints Mechanism, citizens can then turn towards the European Ombudsman. A memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the EIB and the European Ombudsman establishes that citizens (even outside of the EU if the Ombudsman finds their complaint justified) can turn towards the Ombudsman on issues related to 'maladministration' by the EIB. Note that before going to the Ombudsman, an attempt must be made to resolve the case by contacting the EIB. In addition, the complaint must be made within two years of the date when the facts on which your complaint is based became known to you. You can write to the Ombudsman in any of the languages of the European Union. Additional details, including filing requirements and complaint forms, are available at: http://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/atyourservice/interactiveguide.faces"

The Independent Consultation and Investigation Mechanism (MICI) is the independent complaint mechanism and fact-finding body for people who have been or are likely to be adversely affected by an Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) or Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC)-funded project. If you submit a complaint to MICI, they may assist you in addressing the problems you raised through a dispute-resolution process with those implementing the project and/or through an investigation to assess whether the IDB or IIC is following its own policies for preventing or mitigating harm to people or the environment.  You can submit a complaint by sending an email to MICI@iadb.org.
