You’ve got the passion, the education, the experience — but now you just can’t find a job. And you’re not the only one: young conservationists are reporting a tough, rough time out there, with intense competition, a flood of unpaid internships, a prevalence of short-term work, and high student-loan debt. A recent study in Conservation Biology\\xa0attempts to uncover some concrete data on the hard-to-quantify conservation job market in an effort to help students prepare themselves for the competitive, challenging hunt for paid employment. Headed by Jane Lucas, a recent recipient of a Ph.D. in rainforest ecology from the University of Oklahoma, the study looks at postings for 200 conservation-related jobs, half in the U.S. and half in other countries. She and her co-authors used the postings, as well as interviews with 20 conservation professionals, to find out where the bulk of the jobs are and to compile a comprehensive list of the most desirable skills for young conservationists seeking careers. Looking at four sectors — nonprofit, academia, government and private industry — Lucas and her colleagues found that the nonprofit sector had the biggest piece of the pie, comprising half of the job listings. Meanwhile, government jobs made up 21 percent, private industry nearly 16 percent, and academia just 13 percent.…',\n",

    "'Nuku’alofa, February 22, 2018 – Following the severe impact of Tropical Cyclone Gita, the World Bank has now begun work to support the government of Tonga, which is leading a Rapid Damage Assessment to assist with recovery and reconstruction planning in the coming months.\\n\\n“Our work in mapping the damage wreaked by Cyclone Gita will be crucial to helping the government of Tonga to determine priority areas for recovery and reconstruction,” said World Bank Country Director for Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands, Michel Kerf. “In the immediate aftermath of recent natural disasters in the Pacific, including cyclones Winston (Fiji, 2016) and Pam (Vanuatu, 2015)_, the World Bank has been called upon to lead the immediate damage assessment process.”_\\n\\nThe World Bank, together with partners including the governments of Australia and New Zealand, the Asian Development Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, European Union and United Nations Development Programme, is now working alongside Tongan authorities to identify priority sectors for the rapid damage assessment, which include housing, agriculture and energy.\\n\\nAs part of this assessment work, a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, or drones) have been transported to Tonga with the support of the Australian government, to provide a comprehensive visual assessment of the damage caused by Cyclone Gita.\\n\\nTonga has received a payout of more than US$3.5 million from the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Company (PCRIC) – the first payout made by the region’s first catastrophe risk insurance platform established in 2016. PCRIC was formed as part of the World Bank’s regional project PCRAFI: Furthering Disaster Risk Finance in the Pacific, which provides technical assistance to 14 Pacific Island countries, with financial support from Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\\n\\n“Despite the tragic circumstances, it has been good to see the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Company delivering much-needed relief through its disaster insurance system,” _said Mr. Kerf. “This is the first payout of its kind, and is a testament to the hard work of many governments and development partners, who have worked hard over many years to create this critical support system for the Pacific Islands, home to many of the world’s most disaster at-risk countries.”_\\n\\nThe World Bank continues to stand as a dedicated partner in resilient development in the Pacific Islands.'\"\"\")"
