      "The World Bank is to support the implementation of the Ghanaian government’s Multi-Sectorial Integrated Mining Project (MSIMP) with an investment of $50m, of which $30m will be a loan and the remaining $20m a grant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project aims to eliminate illegal small-scale mining – known colloquially as galamsey – in the country’s Eastern region. As part of the project, district assemblies will establish mining communities whose trained personnel will monitor sustainable mining in their districts and ensure that all local miners are registered and tracked to clamp down on illegal mining operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Announcing the plans, MSIMP acting national project coordinator Dr Isaac Bonsu Karikari added that the country’s ban on small-scale mining ‘would be lifted soon’, but that a date could not be given, according to the Ghana News Agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Small-scale mining has been banned in Ghana since January 2017, when the government put in place a six-month ban following the destruction of water resources and forest reserves as a result of illegal mining activities. The ban was then extended in October 2017 and January 2018, and is now effectively an indefinite ban on small-scale mining operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the government has met with the Small Scale Miners Association to discuss lifting the ban, the talks have not produced results and Ghana seems to be set on a top-down approach to eradicating small-scale mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karikari read a speech on behalf of deputy Eastern regional minister Joseph Tettey, which praised the work of the Media Coalition Against Galamsey (MCAG) group. Squadron leader Omani Agyei of Operation Vanguard, the group of police officers and soldiers who enforce the ban, pushed for the group to be given access to drones to detect illegal miners. Agyei also claimed that his team had seized 101 guns and over 2,000 bullets from small-scale mining operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "MCAG have held eight town hall meetings and several other stakeholder meetings across Ghana to help local communities eliminate small-scale mining. \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“As per ADB guidelines, projects sought for funding should be encroachment free. The sites which we have allocated for construction of small flyovers are all encroachment free which makes it more likely that ADB will sanction funding for its construction,” said Wani, adding that team from ADB will visit Kashmir next month for assessing the project.\n",

      "The Chamber of Commerce's chairman yesterday called for \"a real hard look\" at a Business Licence fee formula many in the private sector blame for plunging their businesses into loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael Maura told Tribune Business this was one of many issues the Government must address during its upcoming Budget process, along with the completion of projects to boost efficiency within the public sector and cross-border trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We would expect, and hope, there's a real had look at the Business Licence fee formula,\" he said of the 2018-2019 Budget, which will be unveiled in Parliament today. \"It has been dependent on gross turnover, which has resulted in many businesses in various years paying taxes that have caused them to lose money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We would hope the Government will consider a gross profit formula that takes into consideration the cost that businesses have incurred.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Government has already hired the UK arm of the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm to review the Business Licence fee structure as part of a wider study of the Bahamian tax system, which will also focus on the implications of impending World Trade Organisation (WTO) membership and the pressures on the financial services industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "K P Turnquest, Deputy Prime Minister, told Tribune Business in a recent interview that the Government is aware of the Business Licence fee's \"unfairness\" - especially where high turnover, low margin businesses such as food stores and gas stations were concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emphasising that the Government remains committed to addressing this, Mr Turnquest also acknowledged the need for certainty and predictability with a Bahamian tax system that is frequently tinkered with in the annual Budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're very cognisant, if you will, of the unfairness of the tax,\" he said of the Business Licence. \"This is one of the reasons we are having the study done to see how we can make the tax more progressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is an important consideration for us. This was one of the things we promised in our campaign; to look at the fairness of the Business Licence fee, particularly as it relates to high turnover, low margin businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We believe, fundamentally, that no tax should be so burdensome that it creates a negative cash flow and puts businesses into a loss. Whatever changes we make have to be incremental and be well thought-out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Turnquest declined to comment further, saying he did not want to \"prejudge\" Deloitte UK's findings. He added that the accounting firm's study would identify the various tax reform options available to the Bahamas, given the challenges and pressures it is facing, and the implications associated with implementing each one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Business Licence fee's calculation on gross turnover is viewed as penalising high turnover, low margin businesses while favouring low turnover businesses that are more profitable. Tribune Business has received complaints from numerous companies that they pay more in annual Business Licence fees than they do in profits, and/or that the fees push them into losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Turnquest, meanwhile, agreed that business and investor confidence will be boosted by a return to certainty and predictability with the Bahamas' taxation system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have come through a period of change with VAT's introduction,\" he told Tribune Business. \"We have to constantly bear in mind and plan for WTO and what that may mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We want any changes to be detailed and for the long-term. We certainly don't want to be tinkering with the tax system on an annual basis. We have to have certainty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Maura, meanwhile, yesterday called for the Government to ensure there was sufficient funding in the 2018-2019 Budget to bring projects designed to improve Customs and public sector efficiency to fruition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We would be looking, and hoping, that the Government will continue to push for and work towards a more efficient, leaner government,\" he told Tribune Business. Critical to this, Mr Maura added, was progress on a host of Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) funded projects, including reform of the public sector's financial management and reporting process.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is intended to improve the Government's budgeting, accounting and procurement processes, and the Chamber chairman added that moves to e-government were also essential to enhance public sector \"efficiency and competitiveness\".\n",
      "\n",
      "With the current tax-paying process \"very time consuming, expensive and inefficient\" for government and taxpayers alike, Mr Maura said: \"We would be hoping to realise cross-agency connectivity to end the need to engage the government on so many fronts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He also urged the Government to complete the Customs' Electronic Single Window (ESW) project, which promises to boost efficiency - and reduce time and costs - associated with the movement of goods in and out of the Bahamas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will be transformative in terms of the trading experience and clearing of cargo,\" the Chamber chairman told Tribune Business. \"It's a 24/7 system. Whereas today a significant component of Bahamas Customs is electronic, the decision-making part of the system is a manual process.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This means the Customs entries only get processed in a working week. In the future, this Electronic Single Window is an intuitive system, smart system built into it. People will be able to clear their cargo at midnight and pay for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will just take a few minutes. That's the type of thing we have to make sure the Budget identifies as priorities, and they dedicate or direct monies to ensure these projects are completed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Maura also called for a focus on the Small Business Development Centre that the Government has partnered with the University of the Bahamas (UoB) and Chamber of Commerce on. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"In the last few years we saw a lot of advances and economic reforms in Brazil to fix the fiscal side,\" said Moreno. \"Although the pension reform failed to advance, it is positive that society is open to discuss such reform. I am sure the next administration will assume with a commitment to approve the pension reform,\" he said.\n",

      "Faced with a challenging fiscal scenario, Brazil is seeking to attract more investment from the private sector.\n",

      "\n",
      "The current economic scenario remains turbulent due to an ongoing truckers´ strike across the nation and also due to the October presidential election, where the more market-friendly candidates are struggling in the polls.\n",
      "\n",

      "Indonesia’s coal industry is enjoying a resurgence, driven both by rising demand from China — the world’s biggest consumer of the fossil fuel — and a push by the government in Jakarta to build more coal-fired power plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Producers in Indonesia, one of the world’s biggest coal exporters, are seen as maximizing their output in response to the current favorable market conditions, confident that domestic demand will serve as a buffer against another export slump.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, activists warn that the coal rush will only hasten Indonesia’s “environmental destruction,” citing the high costs that the mining and power-generation industries have already exacted on both the ecosystem and communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "JAKARTA —Demand for energy in China and Indonesia continues to drive the resurgence of the latter’s coal industry, setting back efforts in both countries to shift to a greater share of renewable energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mining, freight and trade executives were largely upbeat at what was billed as the coal industry’s biggest event of the year, the 24th Coaltrans Asia, on the Indonesian resort island of Bali earlier this month. Analysts who attended the three-day conference said the outlook in China was still very strong, especially for coal from Indonesia, one of the world’s biggest exporters of the fossil fuel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arcandra Tahar, Indonesia’s deputy minister for energy and mines, said the government planned to increase its investment in the coal and minerals sector this year to $6.2 billion. He also told the Coaltrans Asia conference that Indonesia had no plans to reduce coal exports, Reuters reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indonesia’s coal exports are expected to hit 371 million metric tons this year, up 7 percent from last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domestic demand is also driving the boon for Indonesia’s coal producers, thanks to an ambitious government plan to add 56 gigawatts (GW) of electricity capacity across the archipelago by 2027, mostly through the construction of new coal-fired power plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bambang Gatot Ariyono, the energy ministry’s head of coal and minerals, told the conference in Bali that the government had moved beyond seeing coal as just a commodity. “Coal is now seen as a source of energy to support the national industry growth,” he said as quoted by tambang.co.id.\n",
      "\n",
      "Demand from China\n",
      "\n",
      "While China has been at the forefront of the global shift to renewables, spending more on domestic renewable energy than any other country, a report by the Global Carbon Project, an international consortium, projected China’s emissions in 2017 jumped by 3.5 percent, after declining by 0.3 percent the year before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind China’s renewed appetite for coal is the robust economic growth in the world’s biggest energy consumer. With the construction of natural gas infrastructure proceeding slower than expected, much of the growing demand for electricity has had to be met by burning more coal. As a result, China’s consumption of coal rose by 0.4 percent last year, the first increase since 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We often laud China as the new renewables champion, and indeed, if we talk about quantity and scale, no one can beat India and China,” Adhityani Putri, national director of the Center for Energy Research Asia (CERA), a Jakarta-based think tank, told reporters in Jakarta.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But on the other hand, they’re still adding substantial coal power capacity, and that’s influencing the coal industry dynamic,” she said. “Until India and China truly stop [burning coal], coal will remain attractive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The prospects for coal are markedly different from just a few years ago, when the price of the fossil fuel hit a 12-year low in 2015 — the result of a production glut in countries like Indonesia, and a shift to renewables by major consumers such as China and India. The coal price now is at its highest point since 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domestic drive\n",
      "\n",
      "The demand from China is good news for Indonesia’s coal producers. But if the export market takes another tumble, they will have a booming domestic market to fall back on this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "To meet its coal export target, Indonesia aims to increase its production by 5 percent this year, to 485 metric million tons (MMT). If it achieves this figure, this year will mark the fourth in a row that the country’s coal production has exceeded the threshold set by the government in its mid-term national development plan, called the RPJMN.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan calls for production to taper down each year, settling at 400 MMT by 2019. Instead, not only has production exceeded the target each year — it has increased every year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A major factor behind this trend is the growing domestic demand. At present, Indonesia’s coal-fired power plants require about 80 to 90 MMT of coal per year, or roughly 80 percent of the locally mined coal that is allocated for the domestic market.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Slowly but sure, we’re starting to prioritize domestic needs,” said Bambang, the energy ministry’s coal chief. “Based on the national development plan, the domestic market [for coal] has increased 27 percent each year, and in 2019, we hope it’ll increase by 60 percent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elrika Hamdi, an energy finance analyst from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a Cleveland, Ohio-based think tank, noted that the 10-year business plan from state-owned power utility PLN indicated it was on a building spree: “there are going to be many new coal-fired plants operating in 2020 and 2021,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coal producers, she added, are “trying to dig as much coal as they can while it’s still possible. They’re capitalizing on the moment [when] the coal price is high, with the [Coaltrans Asia] conference saying the price will be stable or even have an upward trend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Damper on renewables\n",
      "\n",
      "The bullish outlook for coal, driven in large part by government policy, could spell trouble for the renewable energy market in Indonesia, which is already struggling to compete with the ubiquitous fossil fuel, analysts say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indonesia will miss its target of generating 23 percent of its energy from new and renewable sources by 2025 unless it makes significant policy and regulatory changes, according to a report from the Geneva-based Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI) of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many stakeholders we spoke to hold this view and have expressed concerns that the current policies do not provide enough incentive to grow renewables,” Richard Bridle, a senior policy adviser at GSI, said at the launch of the report in March. “More friendly regulations will be a critical first step to boosting renewable energy development in Indonesia and building a business case for investment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But right now, the momentum and policy framework are not in favor of renewables — so much so that the coal industry players at the recent Bali conference said they didn’t see renewables as a competitive threat in the Indonesian market.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While speakers at the conference see renewables as a threat because prices for renewables have declined in the past 10 years, it’s not [considered] a threat for Indonesia,” Elrika said. “Even the government of Indonesia says it will still use coal as the base load power source.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bambang said there was no worry about Indonesia depleting its coal reserves, estimated at 13 billion metric tons, in the near term.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If national coal production is 500 million metric tons per year and no new reserves are found, then Indonesia’s coal reserve will be depleted 26 years from now,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change, renewables ‘being ditched’\n",
      "\n",
      "The national government’s attitude to coal is one that’s shared by local authorities, for whom the issues of climate change and renewable energy barely rate a mention in the lead-up to local elections in June, when voters will choose 17 provincial governors, 115 district heads and 39 mayors.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the regional election campaigns, not a single candidate has talked about renewable energy,” said Merah Johansyah, coordinator of the Mining Advocacy Network (Jatam), an NGO. “And next year’s presidential election might not talk about renewables either. So this topic is indeed being ditched.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Merah criticized government policies that he said heavily favor coal for economic reasons and fail to consider its environmental and social impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“First, the industry demands lots of water,” he said, citing the case of the Tanjung Bara power plant owned by PT Kaltim Prima Coal in East Kalimantan province. The plant uses up 12 million liters (3.2 million gallons) of water per month, Merah said — about five times the volume of an Olympic-size swimming pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another environmental impact is the clearing of land for new mines. Across Indonesia, some 440,000 square kilometers (170,000 square miles) of agricultural land has been converted for coal mines, Merah said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a potential loss of 6 million tons of rice per year because coal mines operate on agricultural land,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mining industry is also notorious for leaving behind open pits after exhausting a given site, despite a requirement that the miners fill them in once they cease operations. Thousands of these abandoned pits are scattered throughout Sumatra and Indonesian Borneo, where they fill up with rainwater and turn into ponds where dozens of people, mostly children, have drowned. According to data from Jatam, the provinces with the most abandoned mining pits are South Kalimantan, with 814, and East Kalimantan, with 779.\n",
      "\n",
      "Merah said the Coaltrans Asia conference was effectively a gathering to talk about “the continuation of environmental destruction in Indonesia.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They only talk about the economy of coal. They don’t talk about the external costs of the coal industry,” he said. “Furthermore, the government only talks with businesspeople through the Coaltrans conference. There’s no room for the public to talk with the government.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The 3-day consultation workshop, titled “ADB Country Programming and Public-Private Partnerships in Pakistan,” which started on May 14, at Bhurban near Islamabad, will be attended by over 100 delegates including senior government officials, economists, planners from federal and four provincial governments, and ADB staff. Participants will discuss development opportunities and pipeline of projects as part of ADB’s Country Operation Business Plan, 2019–2021, for Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "ADB Country Director for Pakistan Xiaohong Yang and ADB Office of Public-Private Partnerships Director Takeo Koike opened the workshop by reiterating ADB’s continued commitment to support Pakistan in achieving its key development goals outlined in the ADB-Pakistan country partnership strategy. Yang called for closer coordination and consultation between ADB and partners to ensure smarter investment programmes to better respond to Pakistan’s evolving priorities, particularly in the education and health sectors, as well as in energy, transport, agriculture, and institutional reforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom Head of Economic Growth Group Patricia Seex expressed her appreciation for ADB and the government’s efforts in facilitating an enabling environment and effective regulatory framework to promote PPPs at the national and provincial levels to increase Pakistan’s economic growth—needed to create jobs and help Pakistan achieve middle-income status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning and Development Board for Punjab Chairman Mohammad Jahanzeb Khan and PPP Cell Head and Planning and Development Board of Punjab Member Agha Waqar Javed reaffirmed the government’s commitment to work closely with ADB in delivering high-quality development projects and programmes. They also provided updates on reforms to improve regulatory and policy frameworks conducted by the government intended to encourage greater private sector participation in public sector development programmes with the federal and provincial governments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan’s public investment in infrastructure has historically fallen short of the estimated annual investment need of 7.6 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product, or about $20 billion per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current surge in infrastructure spending reaching more than 67 per cent of the total development budget in the public sector requires effective fiscal consolidation measures and strategies to reduce the deficit and increase efficiencies, including mitigating potential fiscal risks posed by PPPs. The outstanding infrastructure financing from local commercial banks in 2016 was only about $4 billion, with 65 per cent of the local bank’s lending going into energy projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Project financing in Pakistan is only offered by a few commercial banks, with little or no role of capital markets or other financial institutions,” said Yang, adding, “This leads to lack of sufficient financial depth and backing in the country’s domestic credit markets to accommodate the long-gestation of infrastructure projects. In the meantime, we are in short supply of a well prepared and bankable PPP pipeline.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang added, “In this regard, I commend the Sindh and Punjab provincial governments’ efforts to develop their investment frameworks to provide an enabling environment for the private sector to invest in infrastructure. The private sector has responded positively, but more needs to be done to create an effective fiscal risk vetting and management regime for greater private sector partnership in the public sector.”\n",
      "\n",
      "ADB is already providing a total of $200 million in loans for projects supporting PPPs in Punjab and Sindh. The investments will augment and assist the provincial government’s efforts to increase the commercial viability of projects, as well as mobilize more private sector participation in PPPs. The loans will also help develop PPPs across sectors and improve the government’s ability to review, develop, and implement sustainable and fiscally responsible PPP projects. ADB’s efforts are supported by DFID, through a $24 million grant and a $4 million technical assistance, both administered by ADB. \n",

The Rs 176 crore mega project, funded by Asian Development Bank (ADB), initiated a decade ago was shelved due to political tussle between mainstream political parties.\n",

      "The rupee on Tuesday crashed by 56 paise to close below the psychologically-important 68 level against the US dollar at the interbank foreign exchange market - the lowest since January 2017. Blame it all on soaring global crude prices, macro concerns like rising inflation, the uncertainty at the Karnataka polls and sustained foreign fund outflows.

India's current-account deficit, which already widened to $13.5 billion in Q3 FY18, up 87 per cent over the previous quarter, is reportedly forecast to hit its highest level in six years this fiscal.

      "According to him, ADB’s outdated and unreviewed 2009 Energy Policy also leaves the Bank great room for continuing support for destructive fossil fuel industry activities and false climate solutions.\n",

      "“Activities that promote continued coal utilization – such as coal bed methane extraction and use, coal gasification, and coal scrubbers – along with the push for the myth of clean coal energy through the practice of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) are all proliferating with green light from a supposed pro-clean energy ADB,” said Ramamurthi.\n",

      "Philippine Movement for Climate Justice National Coordinator Ian Rivera called out the Bank’s record of financing coal projects that reached $10.735 billion from 2009-2017.

      "“Clearly, the Bank’s failure to adjust its energy policies and strategies is a result of its continued, strong financial interest in coal-based power projects,” said Rivera.\n",

      "“Amidst the fact that these projects emit millions of tons of CO2 each year and that there are global and community efforts to reject fossil fuels which ADB recognizes, the Bank’s financial interest in coal remains unbudged,” he continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Rivera, ADB’s continued inaction on pressing global climate demands has incited further determination and commitment from climate and energy justice activists to press for the transformation of energy systems in Asia.\n",

      "“We challenge ADB, an institution which claims to be for Asian people’s development, to stop being an obstacle to this process of energy transformation and to align itself with the agenda of the Asian people – individuals and communities on the ground that have been impacted most by ADB’s policies and strategies,” he said.\n",

      "Lack of trade finance has negatively impacted Liberia’s economic growth, especially in the agriculture sector –which is heavily reliant on importation of farm implements such as fertilizer and machinery. This has affected the manufacturing sector, which is highly dependent on imported raw materials (intermediate goods) and capital goods (machineries and spare parts).The US$20 million facility will provide access to short-term trade finance and expand the capacity of Liberian banks to extend liquidity support to SMEs to spur development in agriculture, services, manufacturing and construction sectors. It will also give confidence to international banks to enable them provide more lines for Liberian local banks.\n",

These are the findings in a new dissertation in Labour Law from Stockholm University.\n",
      "\n",
      "International Financial Institutions give member states financial support for development in the form of loans. These loans are attached to conditionality requiring recipient states to undertake various reforms, including labour market reforms. In addition, the policy advice, and technical support these institutions provide to the members have a bearing on labour policies in member countries.\n",

      "\n",
      "In accordance with the neoliberal policies of the World Bank and the IMF, freedom of association and collective bargaining are often considered obstacles to flexibility of the labour market and thus obstacles to economic development. These labour rights are therefore seen as instrumental values and are thus promoted only in cases where these IFI's deem the rights necessary to enhance economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The World Bank and the IMF and their economic rationale have an instrumentalist approach to freedom of association and collective bargaining, where these rights are taken into consideration if and when they have an impact on the success of a program or project, like a variable in an equation, rather than a goal in itself\", says Mpoki Mwakagali, the author of the dissertation.\n",

      "What’s Causing Growth to Slow?\n",

      "Hamad Aslam, research director at Elixir Securities Pakistan Pvt. in Karachi, Pakistan, said “Pakistan’s economy can’t grow faster anymore with the external imbalances.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the government has put forward a winning face just a few months ahead of elections, Pakistan’s current account deficit increased 50% in the past year. Both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have warned that the current account deficit could hinder Pakistan’s economic growth. Dwindling exports, diminished foreign investment, and slow global trade are believed to be the main causes behind the growing deficit.\n",

      "\n",
      "These aspirations will be aligned with the international agenda, such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recognising different conditions in our developing member countries, we will pursue differentiated approaches. The country partnership strategy will continue to be the primary platform for defining ADB’s operational focus in each country.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to highlight 10 priorities in Strategy 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, ADB will tackle remaining poverty and increasing inequalities. We will help create quality jobs, promote secondary and tertiary education, expand universal health care, and strengthen social protection programmes. We will focus on lagging areas and pockets of poverty even in middle-income countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we will help accelerate progress in gender equality. We will continue to incorporate gender elements when we design and implement projects and programmes. We will support gender-focused projects in education, health, and financial inclusion. We will promote gender equality in decision making through our projects and technical assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was in Bangladesh this February, I visited an ADB-supported ICT laboratory at a rural school. I was impressed by the enthusiasm of girls and boys to study ICT. One girl stood up and said she wanted to be a satellite engineer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh was proud when I shared this story with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, we will scale up our support to combat climate change, build climate and disaster resilience, and enhance environmental sustainability. ADB will help countries to achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. We will invest in the conservation and restoration of natural capital. We will improve the water-food-energy nexus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, we will build livable cities that are competitive, green, resilient, and inclusive. ADB will support multimodal mass public transport systems in cities, clean water and sanitation, and urban health facilities. ADB will help cities expand sources of funding and enhance inclusive, integrated, and participatory urban planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth, we will promote rural development and food security. ADB will focus on developing agricultural value chains from farm-to-market through investments in rural roads, storage facilities, and mobile connectivity. We will foster advanced technologies in farming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixth, we will strengthen governance. ADB will support public sector management reforms through policy-based lending and dialogue. ADB will help governments enhance their capacity to prepare, implement, and operate high-quality projects. And we will help raise standards globally for environmental and social safeguards, sound financial management, and anti-corruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seventh, we will foster regional cooperation and integration. We will build on our experience in sub-regional cooperation initiatives since the 1990s in Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. We will promote regional public goods such as transportation and logistical networks, and protection against communicable diseases. We will support a regional approach to energy security, education, tourism, and financial stability. ADB will cooperate with existing and emerging international and regional initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eighth, we will mobilise private sector resources to meet the region’s huge development financing needs. Our private sector operations help fill market gaps and promote private sector participation in infrastructure and other development finance. We will further scale up our private sector operations, widen their geographic coverage including new and frontier markets, and expand operations in social sectors such as health and education.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will also continue to promote the effective use of public–private partnerships. We will enhance resource mobilisation through credit enhancement operations and co-financing with bilateral and multilateral partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ninth, we will further strengthen our role as a provider and facilitator of knowledge. I strongly believe that ADB’s value addition is combining finance with knowledge, whether tacit or explicit. We will develop and deliver integrated solutions that extend across sectors. ADB’s knowledge work will strengthen the network of scholars and think tanks in Asia and beyond, and offer Asian perspectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tenth, implementing the new strategy will require a stronger, better, and faster ADB. We will continue to use our financial resources efficiently and creatively. We will invest in our workforce, promote diversity including gender balance, and ensure a respectful workplace. We will expand our presence on the ground. We will dramatically modernise business processes to speed up our services to clients.\n",

      "Collaboration among the countries in South Asia for inter- and intra-regional energy trade has been identified as the most cost-effective way to address growing demand, including increasing energy supply and diversifying energy sources (World Bank, 2008; SAARC Secretariat, 2010; Rahman S. H., Wijayatunga, Gunatilake, & Fernando, 2011).\n",
      "\n",
      "At present, energy trade in South Asia is limited to India and Bhutan and India and Nepal, and trade in petroleum products between India and Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Increased electricity trade would be based on mutually-agreed regulatory frameworks and effective dispute settlement mechanisms, but also on greater political will and trust (Wijayatunga & Fernando, 2013; Shukla & Sharma, 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Increased energy trade would result in numerous benefits on electricity supply costs, installed generation capacity, electricity generation, and cross-border transmission capacity in the region. For example, electricity generation capacity in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, mostly coal-based, could be replaced with increased hydro capacity in Bhutan, Nepal, and Afghanistan (Timilsina & Toman, 2016). Associated policy, legal and regulatory, political, commercial, and legal uncertainties could be mitigated through bilateral agreements (Wijayatunga, Chattopadhyay & Fernando, 2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the countries in South Asia have vast renewable energy potential, development of hydropower and cross-border interconnections have become distinct possibilities to encourage development opportunities (ADB, 2015). The contribution of hydroelectricity to total commercial energy is approximately 50% in Bhutan, 17% in Nepal, 13% in Pakistan, 6% in India, and 4% in Afghanistan. In terms of contribution to the total electricity supply, this is 100% in Bhutan, 92% in Nepal, 33% in Pakistan, and 17% in India (Mukherji, Molden, Rasul, & Wagnon, 2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of this potential for collaboration among countries, South Asia is a region that is mired in political complexities and historic rivalries, hindering regional cooperation (Lama, 2007; Dhungel, 2008; Singh, 2009). The Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin is the second largest hydrological system in the world covering over five countries – India, China, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, and contains the largest concentration of the world’s poor (Biswas, 2001; Mukherji, Molden, Rasul, & Wagnon, 2015. Yet, it remains one of the most underdeveloped regions, largely because resources have not been utilized to the maximum possible benefits for all riparian parties (Ahmad, Biswas, Rangachari, Sainju, 2001; Biswas and Uitto, 2001).\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, the case of India and Bhutan stands out as perhaps the only example in the region where a forward-looking perspective on water and energy issues has resulted in positive outcomes for both countries. Given Bhutan’s “middle path” approach to development [exemplified by its vision of achieving Gross National Happiness (Royal Government of Bhutan, 2009)], its shared historical and cultural ties with India, as well as its small-sized economy and population, collaboration between the two neighbouring countries may be considered unique, instead of a representative or replicable model of diplomacy. Six decades of diplomatic relations and three decades of inter-governmental cooperation on hydropower have helped strengthen the positive bilateral relationship (Ministry of External Affairs, 2012).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is argued that such collaborations reap smaller gains for larger countries like India, in relation to the gains for smaller neighbors like Bhutan (World Bank, 2010; Biswas, 2012). While in absolute terms this still holds true, the strategic importance of Bhutan for India is immense: the countries share strong economic linkages; Bhutan acts as a buffer zone between India and China, which otherwise would have to share additional 6,000 km border; Bhutan has lent support to India in numerous occasions, including during security threats in the case of the Indian northeast states (Personal communications, 2015, 2016). We analyze these issues in depth separately (Saklani, Tortajada and Biswas, forthcoming). However, they have represented landmarks for the close collaboration of both the countries in maintaining peace and security in the region, including energy security. Examining such dimensions is crucial in untangling complex foreign policy choices that are intimately tied with opportunities, and explaining whether and how water and energy can serve as catalysts for regional development.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings are described in the article entitled Hydropower-based collaboration in South Asia: The case of India and Bhutan, recently published in the journal Energy Policy. This work was conducted by Cecilia Tortajada and Udisha Saklani from the National University of Singapore.\n",

      "The 3-day ‘ADB Country Programming and Public-Private Partnerships in Pakistan‘ consultation workshop commenced at Bhurban near Islamabad today. The event was attended by over 100 delegates comprising of senior government officials, leading economists, planners from federal and the four provincial governments and ADB’s key staff. Among others, it was to discuss the development opportunities and pipeline of projects as part of the ADB’s Country Operation Business Plan for the period of 2019 to 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her opening remarks, ADB Country Director for Pakistan Xiaohong Yang, and ADB’s Office of Public-Private Partnerships Director Takeo Koike, underscored ADB’s continued commitment to support Pakistan to achieve its key development goals outlined in the ADB-Pakistan country partnership strategy. Yang urged for a closer coordination and consultation between ADB and partners to ensure for better and smarter investment programs to better respond to Pakistan’s evolving priorities. ADB reengages its operation in education and health sectors in addition to investments in energy, transport, agriculture and institutional reforms.\n",

      "DFID’s Head of Economic Growth Group, Patricia Seexat attended the inaugural session on ‘Public-Private Partnership in Pakistan’ and appreciated ADB and the government’s efforts to create an enabling environment and effective regulatory framework to promote PPPs at national and provincial levels to speed up economic growth that is needed to cater to the increasing number of labor force and to achieve middle income status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning and Development Board Punjab Chairman Mohammad Jahanzeb Khan, and Head of PPP Cell and Member PPP / Planning and Development Board of Punjab Agha Waqar Javed province reiterated government’s commitment to work closely with ADB in delivering high-quality development projects and programs. They also briefed on reforms to improve regulatory and policy frameworks conducted by the government intended to encourage a greater private sector participation in the public-sector development programs with the federal and provincial governments.\n",

      "Pakistan’s public investment in infrastructure has historically fallen short of the estimated annual investment need of 7.6 per cent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The country needs to invest over $20 billion per year on critical infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current surge in infrastructure spending reaching more than 67 per cent of the total development budget in the public sector requires effective fiscal consolidation measures and strategies to reduce the deficit and achieve higher level of efficiencies as PPPs carry fiscal risks that need to be mitigated. The outstanding infrastructure financing from local commercial banks in 2016 was only about $4 billion with 65 per cent of the local bank’s lending going into energy projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Project financing in Pakistan is only offered by a few commercial banks, with little or no role of capital markets or other financial institutions. This leads to lack of sufficient financial depth and backing in the country’s domestic credit markets to accommodate the long-gestation of infrastructure projects. Meantime, we are in short supply of well prepared and bankable PPPs pipeline”, said Yang. “In this regard, I really appreciate the Sindh and Punjab provincial government’s efforts to develop their investment frameworks to provide an enabling environment for private sector to invest in infrastructure. The private sector has responded positively, and I can feel the positive vibes from the success of PPP modalities in Sindh and Punjab. Yet, more need to be done to create an effective fiscal risk vetting and management regime for greater private sector partnership in the public sector,” she added\n",
      "\n",
      "ADB is already providing $200 million in loans ( $100 million each) for projects supporting PPPs in Punjab and Sindh. The investment is to augment and assist the provincial government’s efforts to increase the commercial viability of projects, as well as mobilise more private sector participation in PPPs. The loans also help for developing PPP projects across sector, and improving the government’s ability to review, develop, and implement sustainable and fiscally responsible PPP projects. The ADB loans are supplemented by the Government of the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), through a $24 million grant and a $4 million technical assistance that is administered by ADB.\n",

      "The conundrum of cannabis banking in the U.S. is both a headache for legal marijuana businesses and an intriguing case study for the financial services industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the cannabis market that struggles to access banking services is not limited to small dispensary storefronts (although they are undoubtedly affected by such legal hurdles). The legal marijuana industry in North America, which handled an estimated $9.7 billion in B2C sales last year, includes a complex ecosystem of cultivators, logistics providers, lawyers, accountants, contractors and more — meaning an entire supply chain of B2B service providers is impacted when a legal marijuana company cannot get banked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation is improving, however: According to the latest FinCEN Marijuana Banking Update report, the number of banks and credit unions providing services to the cannabis industry in the U.S. has steadily grown since 2014, now reaching about 400.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Kendell Lang, CEO of Fusion Bank, even with the rise in access to financial services for this sector, major service gaps remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial institutions (FIs) that service the industry, he recently told PYMNTS, “don’t have the compliance people, processes or automated tools in place to meet the required guidelines — and are unknowingly putting their clients at risk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not like opening an account for a gift shop,” he warned, noting that such a business opening a bank account will not see that institution scrutinize every single product for compliance. “Traditional banks are not required to verify that the source of the products being sold is legal from the moment of production until it reaches the display case and is sold. Traditional banks are not required to know that you are selling Hallmark cards to minors. The cannabis industry is an entirely different animal and needs an entirely new kind of compliance model to be taken seriously and to mitigate the risks for everyone involved.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fusion Bank targets the legal cannabis market with its cash and treasury management solutions. Licensed under the Sovereign Friendly Society, a Bahamas-based Friendly Society providing banking, insurance and other membership services to medical marijuana players, the members-only FI is particularly focused on compliance, an ever-evolving and complicated topic for this sector in the U.S. today. According to Lang, traditional FIs cannot meet this regulatory compliance and reporting need.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present, Fusion Bank facilitates bill payments, staff payments, tax payments, wire transfers and transfer receipts for its customers; the FI also integrates with some third-party platforms like Bill.com, though Lang mentioned that every third-party integration has to support its focus on transparency, “which means visibility across the entire ecosystem of vendors up and down the product lifecycle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He noted that moving forward, Fusion Bank aims to introduce added features that are commonly requested by customers, including “debit card facilities, ATM withdrawals, insurance and investment opportunities” — each subject to rigorous compliance initiatives before services can be made available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marijuana companies must be a member of the Sovereign Friendly Society to apply for a bank account, he explained, adding that Fusion Bank is compliant with the FinCEN guidelines drawn out by U.S. policymakers in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The guidelines are rigorous and expensive to adhere to,” he said. “They require due diligence, background checks and on-sight inspections before a new member can be approved. They’re exhaustive but necessary, and we are willing to do the work in order to serve the cannabis community, where many other banks prefer to steer clear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The regulatory hurdles involved in this sector aren’t just a challenge for financial service providers; they’re also a headache for the businesses operating in the industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are signs the regulatory landscape is easing. Big names like PayPal and HP have shown support, while FinTech innovators have introduced a slew of new offerings for the industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lang said that when it comes to the cannabis market’s journey toward financial services, “it’s not a matter of if; it’s a matter of when.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every day, the news is inundated with small victories at the city and state level — new legislature and new bills being passed that make it easier and easier for cannabis businesses to establish a foothold and conduct their business without interference by the Feds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He pointed to proposed legislation that would provide federal protection to financial institutions that service legal cannabis companies: Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of 18 lawmakers petitioned Congress to legalize marijuana banking, but the White House remains cold on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course, the industry is still riddled with challenges,” continued Lang, “many, if not most, of which stem from the drug’s Schedule I status. We believe, however, that it’s inevitable that financial services will become freely available to cannabis businesses — it’s a booming industry that’s not going to lose momentum.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lawmakers have a long road ahead, he added, particularly when it comes to keeping pace with changing legislation and drafting new laws to ease marijuana players’ access to financial services. And while the number of financial institutions that service industry players has steadily increased, Lang noted that they remain only a small fraction of the nation’s banking sector overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We believe there is demand in California alone that will require 200 banks, so there will eventually be many more options than exist today,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As financial service providers navigate the legal cannabis market and regulatory potholes that come with it, Lang said there are several key focuses firms like Fusion Bank should have: “One, the public safety issue — getting cash off the streets — which is a major concern,” he said. “Two, the need for medicinal research. Three, free patient access to medicine they need; and four, the enormous ‘give back’ value this industry offers in terms of tax.” \n",

      "Can a shift in demographics lead to ripple effects – and maybe even a sea change – in the way gig economy workers get paid?\n",
      "\n",
      "The PYMNTS Gig Economy Index has estimated that gig workers account for 3.7 percent of GDP, worth roughly $711 million in income in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right alongside those tallies, payroll cards are gaining traction, having accounted for six million cards at the end of last year and expected to grow to as many as eight million cards in 2022, Aite Group reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise of the gig economy – and the embracing of payment cards – speaks to a desire of the project-based workforce to have flexibility in what they do, career-wise, and how they get paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted in a recent report commissioned by ADP, roughly half of Generation Z (47 percent) and about a third of millennials (at 31 percent) would turn down a job if unable to choose how money ends up in their pockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same study found that 47 percent of millennials and 66 percent of those belonging to the Generation Z cohort have used preloaded payment cards within the past 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "To that end, as of Monday (May 14), ADP has introduced Wisely Pay by ADP. The company has billed the service as a way for employers to tailor payments to the gig economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview with Karen Webster, Mark Putman, general manager at ADP Payments, said that Wisely Pay builds off of Global Cash Card (acquired last year) and the ADP platform, working in tandem to offer funds to workers in flexible ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the “how and when” that makes for a loyal relationship between 1099 workers and the platforms and employers that employ them. Consider the fact that under the typical payment model, gig workers invoice their employers and then wait 30, 60 or even 90 days to get paid, as disbursements are tied to the procurement process.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the individual on the receiving end of long wait times, said Putman, it’s hard to budget when you are subject to the vagaries of extended payout cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the gig economy and for younger workers, issues include, as Putman put it, “how do I get paid, how do I manage my taxes, what do I need to withhold?” These younger workers may be navigating a brave new world of sorts, as those aforementioned issues were “always taken care of in my parents’ and my grandparents’ generation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "No longer is that the case – with freelancers, withholding and other activities (such as paying for healthcare and FICA) are up to them, not the employer. Putman said those workers in Generations Z, as well as millennials, could use a little assistance with earmarking of funds due to Uncle Sam and others. One might liken it to an envelope approach where funds are allocated to different “buckets,” which can help budget for goals like retirement and vacations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its release Monday morning, the company said that Wisely Pay by ADP is the first offering that gives administrative tools and support to employers across verticals, catering to full-time, part-time and freelance workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putman noted that the average checking account fee is $40 a month and that the fee schedule for the new ADP offering is substantially lower (and, in addition, roughly 60 million Americans do not rely on traditional checking accounts to conduct their financial lives). Wisely Pay’s payment options extend across the digital payments platform built by Global Cash Card and ADP’s Instant Funding API.\n",
      "\n",
      "In reference to flexibility, Wisely Pay offers its users several conduits through which they can receive, spend and manage money once they submit an invoice. Those options include peer-to-peer transfers, instant pay and digital wallets, such as the “pays” offered by Samsung and Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wisely Pay dovetails with ADP compliance solutions and an electronic payment program that is extant across 50 states. Writ large, consider Wisely Pay a banking alternative, said Putman, to be made available through the pay card beginning in September in the United States.\n",

      "The Asian Development Bank has called for government investment to scale up sustainable agriculture insurance in Bangladesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The agriculture insurance market is underdeveloped and the government should enact a policy to help the sector to mature,” Manmohan Parkash, country director of ADB, said at a seminar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parkash made a set of recommendations at the seminar styled “Financial protection towards agriculture risk mitigation in Bangladesh” held yesterday at the capital's Radisson Blu Dhaka Water Garden hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recommendations were made based on the experience of the pilot project 'Weather Index-based Crop Insurance' funded mostly by the Manila-based multilateral lender and run by Sadharan Bima Corporation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crop insurance is an insurance package designed for farmers to protect them from crop losses due to natural disasters such as hail, drought, floods and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farmers in Bangladesh are more vulnerable to the vagaries of weather than most due to climate change making the country highly susceptible to the increasing monsoon floods and tropical cyclones.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they cannot protect themselves against the devastating climatic events because traditional insurers have been unable to come up with suitable crop insurance schemes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ADB-administered programme allows a farmer to claim compensation from his/her insurer when certain climatic trigger points are hit, such as cyclone or tropical storm in a given area hits a specified magnitude or when rainfall rises above or drops a certain level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having this kind of cover would give farmers the ability to continue to plan and save for the longer term even if their harvests are suddenly and arbitrarily destroyed by bad weather, the ADB said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new weather index in conjunction with the Bangladesh Meteorological Department was generated using weather data for the past 25-30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "A total of 12,000 small farmers came under insurance coverage against the target of 6,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ADB provided a grant of $2 million to run the pilot project in three districts: drought-prone Rajshahi, flood-prone Sirajgonj and cyclone-prone Noakhali. Some 20 automated weather observation machines were installed on the roofs of different upazila parishad buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The feedback from the pilot project is very encouraging,” Parkash said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A partnership between the public and private sectors is needed to make agri insurance less expensive to farmers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The financial sector policymakers should acknowledge that agriculture insurance is a useful instrument to transfer financial risk away from the farmer, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parkash went on to advise financial institutions to introduce agriculture insurance tagged with farm credit to encourage farmers to take insurance coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also emphasised on adoption of technology for agriculture insurance to get early warnings, which will enable farmers to avoid weather risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadharan Bima collected a total of Tk 51.36 lakh as premium from farmers. Of the sum, subsidy from the ADB and government was Tk 21.97 lakh, according to a presentation made at the seminar.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, insurance claims amounting to Tk 53.46 lakh were settled under the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pilot, which began in March 2014, will end on June 30.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Crop insurance is popular in neighbouring India,” said Md Safiqur Rahman Patwari, chairman of the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "But despite being an agro-based country, it is yet to be introduced in Bangladesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Climate change has intensified natural hazards and disasters, posing huge threats for the agriculture sector. So, it is high time that agriculture insurance is embraced to reduce farming losses.”\n",
