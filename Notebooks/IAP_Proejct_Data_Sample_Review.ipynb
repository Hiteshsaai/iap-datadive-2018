      "From the IDB: \"The main objective of this project is to improve the productivity of the livestock sector in Belize through the promotion of pasture intensification, while at the same time addressing the low capacity for adaptation to climate change of especially small and medium-sized producers. Rapid growth in Belizean livestock, in response to growing demand in the tourism sector as well as in domestic and international markets, has resulted in the opening up of new pastureland in order to meet nutrient requirements of herds largely dependent on natural pastures with low feed supplementation and water conservation strategies in place. Any efforts for the sustainable intensification of livestock production in Belize, must consider the challenges that climate change poses, not only for productivity, but also with respect to ecosystems. This critically requires building the capacity of all producers to adapt in order to build climate change resiliency and to reduce environmental impacts such as deforestation, soil degradation and unsustainable water consumption.\"\n",
