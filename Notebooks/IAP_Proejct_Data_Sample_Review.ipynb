The World Bank is co-financing in the form of an Additional Financing for the existing WB-financed Tarbela Fourth Extension Hydropower Project. Built in the 1970s, the Tarbela Dam is one of the largest earth-fill dam constructions in the world.This project will consist of:(1) the installation of a power house at the fifth tunnel (Tunnel 5) of the Tarbela Dam and(2) the construction of a transmission line to connect the power to the national grid.  The project will add capacity of 2,820 megawatts with annual electricity generation of 4,800 gigawatt-hours.The Tarbela Dam is located on the Indus River, upstream of the Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Project, which AIIB documents note \"had issues related to resettlement and land acquisition.\" The power generation element of the Project (construction of power house and modification of the existing Tunnel 5) will be implemented on the left bank of the Indus River, in an area concentrated around the inlet and outlet of Tunnel 5 of the Tarbela Dam. The proposed transmission line will be about 50 km long and will be connected to a new Islamabad West Grid Station.The World Bank is the lead co-financier and as such, its environmental and social safeguard policies will apply to this project.The project implementation period is January 2017 to March 2022.\n",
